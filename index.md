This project attempts to provide quick access to all US Federal APIs.  There are a few lists that approach this goal but none are perfect.  The goals for this site include a catalog that is:  

* Comprehensive and Up-To-Date  
* Automatically Maintained   
* Supportive of Publication Elsewhere  
  
## The Plan

1. [Find any other catalogs of Federal APIs](https://github.com/unitedstates/APIs/issues/8)
2. [Find ways to compare the catalogs to see where gaps exist](https://github.com/unitedstates/APIs/issues/10)
3. [Engage with catalogs to manually update with missing APIs](https://github.com/unitedstates/APIs/issues/9)
4. [Develop a system that can allow  the catalogs to stay in sync](https://github.com/unitedstates/APIs/issues/7)
